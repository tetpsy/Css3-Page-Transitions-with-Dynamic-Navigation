Dynamic Page Transitions with Css3


Based on Codrops Css3 Page transitions..

i extended the script so that you can navigate from any page to any page not limited to next and previous..

also added a feature that if you navigate to a page previous to the current page then a previous transition will happen .
if you go to a page thats next after the current page it will do a next transition.

i had to create my own class script with jquery to acheive this , it is quite straight forward tho..

i also have support for keyboard and mouse-scroll events it is not included but will be soon.
